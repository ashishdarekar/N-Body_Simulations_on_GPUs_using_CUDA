To use the code, you will need The NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit version 
1.0 or later, available at http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda

**Building the Code**   
Linux:
1. Go to the cuda_seminar_nbody_2020 directory 
2. Go to "constant.h" : To change the problem input parameters like Number of iterations, VTKWRITE flag (Default parameters are provided)
3. make clean
4. make 

**Running the code for Visualization**
(With Visualization of Results)
(VTKWRITE 1)

There are three execution codes: (Command options must provide)
1. CPU Serial Code:           ./serial -s 1024
2. CPU Code with OpenMP:      ./serial_omp -s 1024
3. GPU Code:                  ./self_cuda_tile -s <Number of bodies> -b <Block size>
        eg.:                  ./self_cuda_tile -s 16384 -b 128

Results: VTK files stored in "serial_solution_cuda_seminar" for Serial Code and Serial With OpenMP
                             "cuda_solution_cuda_seminar" for CUDA code
         Can be locally visualize ParaView
      
**Running this code for Performance Benchmarking**
Performance Benchmarking: Python scripts are provided (exec.sh, serial_exec.sh, serial_omp.sh)
(VTKWRITE 0)

Performance Benchmarking with NVIDIA code: Python script is provided (perf.sh)
(VTKWRITE 0)
